<h1 id="reducingdirectedgraphs">Reducing directed graphs</h1>
<h2 id="descriptionoftheproblem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p>I looked at certain minimal graphs in <a
href="http://kaygun.tumblr.com/post/32394831596">a previous post</a>.
These were Hasse subgraphs obtained by a reduction algorithm which we
will now call <em>Hasse reduction</em> which was defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every edge <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> do</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remove <span class="math inline">\(x=(u,v)\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</li>
<li>If in the new graph <span class="math inline">\(G\setminus
x\)</span> there is no path from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span>
to <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> then put <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> back in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Otherwise, leave <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> out.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>Today I will look at another kind of reduction. I am going to
consider the following kind of graphs:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a finite directed acyclic
graph.</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has a unique source <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and a unique sink <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I will call such graphs <em>admissible</em>. It is not very difficult
to show that in an admissible graph for every vertex <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> there is a path from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and there is a path from <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. I will show this <strong>Lemma
1</strong> below.</p>
<p><strong>Lemma 1:</strong> Assume <span
class="math inline">\(G=(V,E)\)</span> is a directed admissible graph
with a unique source <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> and a unique
sink <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Then for every vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\in V\)</span> there is a path from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and there is a path from <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof:</strong> Assume <span class="math inline">\(v\in
V\)</span> is a vertex in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. We
will prove the existence of a path from <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. The proof for a path from <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> is similar. If <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> is the source then we have the trivial
path <span class="math inline">\((s)\)</span> of length <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the proof is completed. So, assume
<span class="math inline">\(v_0=v\)</span> is not the source. Then there
is another vertex <span class="math inline">\(v_1\in
V\setminus\{v_0\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\((v_1,v_0)\)</span> is an edge. We proceed by
induction. At each inductive step the vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v_n\)</span> we obtain is distinct from all of the
vertices <span class="math inline">\({v_1,\ldots, v_{n-1}}\)</span>
since <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contains no cycles. The
process must terminate since <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> is a
finite set, and the process ends at a source. Since <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has a unique source, this vertex must
be <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> be the unique source of
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be the unique sink of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. The type of minimal graph I would like
to consider satisfies the following condition: if <span
class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> is an edge in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> then every path connecting <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> passes through <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span>, and every path connecting <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> passes through <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span>.</p>
<p>In order to generate such minimal admissible graphs, I will apply the
following algorithm which I will call as <code>Reduce</code>. Assume
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> denotes the unique source of
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> denote the unique sink of <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For every edge <span class="math inline">\(x=(u,v)\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> do</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Remove the edge <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span></li>
<li>If there are no paths from <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> or there are no paths from <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(G\setminus x\)</span> then add <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> back to <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Otherwise leave <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> out.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>There is an important detail we need to check before we proceed: How
do we know that later in the for loop removing an edge destroys the
connectivity of another vertex <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span>?
Assume, by way of contradiction, that we have a graph and we removed an
edge <span class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> and it happened that we
have another vertex <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> such that
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> is not connected to <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is not connected to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> because all such paths contained <span
class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span>. Assume, without loss of
generality, that <span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> lost its
connection to <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> because the edge
<span class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> was on all paths connecting
<span class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. Since <code>Reduce</code> is going to
remove <span class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> we necessarily have
that <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> connected to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> via a path. But <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> is connected to <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> because all paths from <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> passes through <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> by our assumption. Then removing <span
class="math inline">\((u,v)\)</span> will not separate <span
class="math inline">\(w\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. This is a contradiction.</p>
<h2 id="animplementationinpython">An implementation in python</h2>
<p>For the implementation of the new reduction algorithm below, I will
assume that the unique source is labelled by <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and the unique sink is labelled by the
number 1 less than the number of vertices in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code> import igraph

 def Reduce(G):
     source = 0
     sink = len(G.vs())-1
     for edge in G.get_edgelist():
         u = edge[0]
         v = edge[1]
         G.delete_edges([edge])
         if len(G.get_shortest_paths(source,v)[0])==0 or len(G.get_shortest_paths(u,sink)[0])==0:
            G.add_edges([edge])
     return(G)</code></pre>
<p>Let us test the algorithm on a graph which is not minimal:</p>
<pre><code> g = igraph.Graph(6)
 g.to_directed()
 g.add_edges([(0,1),(4,5),(2,5),(1,3),(0,2),(3,4),(2,3),(3,5),(0,3),(1,5)])</code></pre>
<p><img src="../media/2012-10-15-reducing_directed_graphs_5.png" /></p>
<p>Now, let us reduce the graph using our algorithm:</p>
<pre><code> h = Reduce(g)</code></pre>
<p><img src="../media/2012-10-15-reducing_directed_graphs_5.png" /></p>
<p>Let us consider another example:</p>
<pre><code> g = igraph.Graph(7)
 g.to_directed()
 g.add_edges([(0,1),(0,2),(1,4),(2,5),(1,3),(3,5),(4,6),(5,6)])</code></pre>
<p><img src="../media/2012-10-15-reducing_directed_graphs_5.png" /></p>
<p>This should be <em>irreducible</em>, that is, it should not change
when we apply <code>Reduce</code>. So, let us reduce it:</p>
<pre><code> h = Reduce(g)</code></pre>
<p><img src="../media/2012-10-15-reducing_directed_graphs_5.png" /></p>
<h2 id="therelationshipwiththehassereduction">The relationship with the
Hasse reduction</h2>
<p><strong>Proposition 2</strong>: Our reduction algorithm
<code>Reduce</code> is stronger than the Hasse reduction algorithm
<code>Hasse</code> in the sense that any edge that is going be removed
using <code>Hasse</code> is going to be removed by <code>Reduce</code>
too. In other words, we have <code>Hasse(Reduce(G)) = Reduce(G)</code>
while it is possible that <code>Reduce(Hasse(G))</code> is strictly
smaller than <code>Hasse(G)</code>.</p>
<p><strong>Proof</strong>: Let us start with the latter statement:
<code>Reduce(Hasse(G))</code> may be strictly smaller than
<code>Hasse(G)</code>. We will demonstrate this with an example.
Consider the graph</p>
<p><img src="../media/2012-10-15-reducing_directed_graphs_5.png" /></p>
<p><code>Hasse</code> reduction algorithm will yield the same graph
while <code>Reduce</code> reduction algorithm will give us</p>
<p><img src="../media/2012-10-15-reducing_directed_graphs_5.png" /></p>
<p>Now, as for our former claim: if <span
class="math inline">\(e=(u,v)\)</span> is an edge and if there is a path
from <span class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(G\setminus e\)</span> then there is a path from
the unique <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> source to <span
class="math inline">\(v\)</span> and there is a path from <span
class="math inline">\(u\)</span> to the unique sink <span
class="math inline">\(t\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(G\setminus e\)</span>. Thus we remove the edge
using the algorithm <code>Reduce</code>. This means every edge that
should be removed using <code>Hasse</code> is removed by the algorithm
<code>Reduce</code>.</p>
