<h1 id="monadic-units">Monadic Units</h1>
<p>There is an aspect of monads that I did not get into in my <a
href="clean/2012-12-16-higher_order_functions_functors_and_monads.html">previous
post on monads</a>: the unit. What I described in there at the end was
slightly less than a monoid: it was a semigroup, which is to say, a
monoid which may or may not have a unit.</p>
<h2 id="semigroups-monoids-and-units">Semigroups, monoids and units</h2>
<p>The most widely used instances of monoids are numbers (naturals,
integers, rationals, reals or complex numbers) together with the
addition operation in which the unit is 0, and numbers together with the
multiplication operation in which the unit is 1.</p>
<p>The defining binary operator with type signature <span
class="math inline">\(M\times M\to M\)</span> (addition or
multiplication in the case of numbers) for a monoid must be associative.
Remember that the defining operator is binary, and therefore, applying
these operators on lists longer than 2 requires making choices of
parenthesizations. The associativity constraint <span
class="math display">\[ a
\circ (b \circ c) = (a\circ b)\circ c \]</span> makes application of
such reduction operators on addition or multiplication together with a
list easier to implement as we do not have to worry about the choices we
have to make.</p>
<p>In order to go further with more elaborate examples on units, we must
think of these elements as unary operators of left and right variants
whose type signatures are <span class="math inline">\(M\to M\times
M\)</span> which is exactly the opposite of the type signature of our
binary operator. In the case of addition operator:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>add-left-unit(x) = (x,0)</code></p>
<p><code>add-right-unit(x) = (0,x)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now, if we apply addition to the resulting pair we get back the
element we started with. There is a similar version of this for
multiplication.</p>
<p>Let me implement these in lisp to demonstrate how it works.</p>
<pre><code>(defun add-left-unit (x) (list 0 x))

(defun add-right-unit (x) (list x 0))

(defvar num (random 10))
num
6

(reduce &#39;+ (add-left-unit num))
6

(reduce &#39;+ (add-right-unit num))
6</code></pre>
<h2 id="the-monad-vectorizeflatten">The monad
<code>(vectorize,flatten)</code></h2>
<p>Going back to monads, let me recall the functions
<code>vectorize</code> and <code>flatten</code> from my <a
href="clean/2012-12-16-higher_order_functions_functors_and_monads.html">previous
post on monads</a>:</p>
<pre><code>(defun vectorize (f) (lambda (x) (mapcar f x)))

(defun flatten (x)
   (cond ((null x) nil)
         ((atom x) (list x))
         (t (mapcan &#39;flatten x))))</code></pre>
<p>In this case <code>vectorize</code> together with
<code>flatten</code> forms a monad, i.e.Â a monoid in the category of
endofunctors. The binary operator of addition or multiplication is
replaced with <code>flatten</code> whose type signature is
<code>flatten::[[a]] -&gt; [a]</code>. This means if we have a unit, its
type signature must be <code>unit:: [a] -&gt; [[a]]</code>. This also
means that I will have be more careful in implementing
<code>flatten</code> and I will redefine it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(defun flatten (x)
   (loop for i in x append i))

(flatten &#39;((0 1) (2 3 4) ((5 6)) (7 8) (9)))
(0 1 2 3 4 (5 6) 7 8 9)</code></pre>
<p>Given a list <span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> of objects of
type <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, there are two ways one can
create a list of list of objects of type <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Either create a new list which contains a single element <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span>.</li>
<li>Or for each <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> create a list containing just <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and combine the results into a new
list.</li>
</ol>
<p>In lisp one possible implementation of these left and right units can
be accomplished as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(defun flatten-right-unit (x) (list x))

(defun flatten-left-unit (x) (funcall (vectorize &#39;list) x))</code></pre>
<p>Let me test these functions against <code>flatten</code>:</p>
<pre><code>(defvar my-list (loop for i from 1 to 10 collect (random 10)))
my-list
(3 0 7 4 1 7 5 1 8 5)

(flatten (flatten-right-unit my-list))
(3 0 7 4 1 7 5 1 8 5)

(flatten (flatten-left-unit my-list))
(3 0 7 4 1 7 5 1 8 5)</code></pre>
<p>In other words, <code>flatten</code> has a unit, which means, the
pair <code>(vectorize,flatten)</code> is really a monad instead of being
a <em>semigroup</em> object in the category of endofunctors.</p>
