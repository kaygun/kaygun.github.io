<h1 id="entropy-and-approximately-one-to-one-maps">Entropy and
approximately one-to-one maps</h1>
<h2 id="description-of-the-problem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p>I thought of this problem as I enter student grades to a spreadsheet.
Here it goes:</p>
<h3 id="the-naive-description">The naive description</h3>
<p>I have a list of students and I want to search for each student using
the search function as I enter their grades. I want to be able to find
the student for whom I am going to enter the grade with fewest possible
keystrokes. What should I do?</p>
<h3 id="the-formal-description">The formal description</h3>
<p>I have a dataset <span class="math inline">\({\mathbf
x}^{(1)},\ldots,{\mathbf x}^{(N)}\)</span> each of which is a word <span
class="math inline">\({\mathbf x}^{(i)} = (x^{(i)}_1\cdots
x^{(i)}_m)\)</span> of length <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>
where <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is the same for every data
point, and each letter <span class="math inline">\(x^{(i)}_j\)</span>
comes from a fixed alphabet <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span>. How do I find an
<em>interval</em> <span
class="math inline">\(j,j+1,\ldots,j+\ell\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,\ldots,m\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[ f({\mathbf x}^{(i)}) =
(x^{(i)}_jx^{(i)}_{j+1}\cdots x^{(i)}_{j+\ell}) \]</span> is one-to-one,
or close to being one-to-one.</p>
<p>Here I choose to ask for an interval as the search function will
require that I enter letter/digits in sequence. The more general
question may require that I ask for a subsequence of indices <span
class="math inline">\(j_1,\ldots,j_\ell\)</span> from <span
class="math inline">\(\{1,\ldots,m\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math display">\[ f({\mathbf x}^{(i)}) =
(x^{(i)}_{j_1} x^{(i)}_{j_2} \cdots x^{(i)}_{j_\ell}) \]</span> is
one-to-one, or close to being one-to-one.</p>
<h2 id="the-entropy">The entropy</h2>
<p>Entering the first few digits of the student id number is usually a
bad idea as the beginning of these numbers designate their admission
years and departments. This means you will have to enter so many digits
for the admission year, and so many years for the department etc. which
is not very random. I need the sequence I enter to separate the
students. We need a part of their numbers with the highest randomness,
a.k.a. <em><a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">entropy</a></em>.</p>
<p>Imagine the hypothetical case of 100 students from two departments
taking my class: 20 from Computer Science and 80 from Electrical
Engineering. Assuming the digits I enter are the department codes, I
will get two groups: CS and EE. The entropy (the measure of randomness)
is <span class="math display">\[ - 0.2 \log_2(0.2) - 0.8 \log_2(0.8)
\approx .722 \]</span> Here I have two groups: CS students (in the group
their total measure is 20%) and EE students (they comprise of 80% of the
group). On the other hand if I found the right interval of digits to
enter I would have gotten each individual student (all 100 of them) in
its own separate group. In that case the randomness measure would have
been <span class="math display">\[
\sum_{i=1}^{100} -0.01 \log_2(0.01) = -\log_2(0.01) = \log_2(100)
\approx 6.644 \]</span></p>
<p>This means, I will have to find the interval <span
class="math inline">\(j,j+1,\ldots,j+\ell\)</span> such that the entropy
of the probability distribution on the projected set <span
class="math display">\[ \pi({\mathbf x}^{(i)}) = (x^{(i)}_{j}\cdots
x^{(i)}_{j+\ell}) \]</span> is close to <span class="math display">\[
-N\cdot
\frac{1}{N}\log_2(1/N) = \log_2(N) \]</span></p>
<p><em>What is the entropy of the probability distribution on the
projected set?</em> you might ask. Imagine you have a finite set <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and a labeling function <span
class="math inline">\(f\colon X\to \mathcal{A} =
\{a_1,\ldots,a_t\}\)</span>. Let <span
class="math inline">\(n_i\)</span> be the number of elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> labeled by <span
class="math inline">\(a_i\in\{a_1,\ldots,a_t\}\)</span> via <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span>. In other words, <span
class="math display">\[ n_i =
\|\{x\in X\|\ f(x) = a_i\}\| \]</span> Then the probability of seeing
the label <span class="math inline">\(a_i\)</span> on the dataset is
<span class="math inline">\(n_i/N\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(N\)</span> is the number of elements in <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span>. Hence, the entropy is <span
class="math display">\[ \sum_{i=1}^t
-\frac{n_i}{N}\log_2(n_i/N) = \log_2(N) - \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^t
n_i \log_2(n_i) \]</span> In case <span
class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> is our alphabet and <span
class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is projection on <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span>-th letter then we would like this value
to be as close to <span class="math inline">\(\log_2(N)\)</span> as
possible. This means we could instead minimize the sum <span
class="math display">\[ \sum_{i=1}^t n_i\log_2(n_i) \]</span></p>
<h2 id="implementation-and-test">Implementation and test</h2>
<p>I will assume that the dataset is given as a lisp list of strings of
length 7 consisting of decimal digits only. My dataset consists of 266
data points. I will load it from a file:</p>
<pre><code>(defparameter *data* 
   (with-open-file (infil &quot;hash-test.txt&quot; :direction :input)
      (let (res)
         (do ((line (read-line infil nil) (read-line infil nil)))
             ((null line) res)
           (push line res)))))

*DATA*</code></pre>
<p>The <code>objective</code> function will take the dataset as a
parameter together with a function <code>fun</code>. It will construct a
hash table whose keys are the data points evaluated under
<code>fun</code> and will count how many times a specific value appears
in the image.</p>
<pre><code>(defun objective (data fun)
   (let ((local (make-hash-table :test &#39;equal)))
      (dolist (x data)
         (if (gethash (funcall fun x) local)
           (incf (gethash (funcall fun x) local))
           (setf (gethash (funcall fun x) local) 1)))
      (let ((res 0d0)) 
         (maphash (lambda (x y) (incf res (* y (log y 2.0d0)))) local)
         res)))

OBJECTIVE</code></pre>
<p>Let me test this on our data on various projections:</p>
<pre><code>(loop for i from 0 to 6 
      collect (format nil &quot;~5,1f&quot; (objective *data* (lambda (x) (char x i)))))

(2055.4 1634.7 1418.1 1268.9 1264.9 1261.7 1363.3)</code></pre>
<p>The results indicate that I should use 4th, 5th and 6th digits to get
the best results. Let me see if the result is better if I calculate the
entropy of the projection function which uses these three digits
together.</p>
<pre><code>(loop for i from 0 to 4 collect
    (format nil &quot;~5,1f&quot; (objective *data* (lambda (x) (subseq x i (+ i 3))))))

(1141.6 460.7 129.6  55.5  87.5)</code></pre>
<p>This confirms our guess: If I were to use the subsequence
<code>(subseq x 3 6)</code> I will get the best result. Let us calculate
the actual entropy, and see if it is close to the maximal entropy 8.1
for the data set we have:</p>
<pre><code>(let* ((N (length *data*))
       (result (- (log n 2.0d0) 
                  (* (/ 1.0d0 n) 
                     (objective *data* (lambda (x) (subseq x 3 6)))))))
   (format nil &quot;~2,1f&quot; result))

7.8</code></pre>
<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The result above indicates, I should type the 4th, 5th and 6th digits
of the students’ id numbers. However, there is a danger of these numbers
colliding with subsequences starting at other positions. For example, I
can type “456” to match “1234567” and yet match also “4567890”. In order
to prevent such collisions, I better create a primary key for each
student using the 4th through 6th digits of the student numbers together
with, say the first letter of their last names. This is a key I can
easily type into the search box of my spreadsheet software as I glance
at each student’s exam paper.</p>
