<h1 id="generating-uniformly-random-trees">Generating Uniformly Random
Trees</h1>
<h2 id="description-of-the-problem">Description of the Problem</h2>
<p>Today, I would like to write an algorithm that would generate a
random tree on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices so that
every such randomly created tree shows up equally likely among all
possible trees on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices.</p>
<h2 id="the-algorithm">The Algorithm</h2>
<p>I will construct the tree as a <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topologically
ordered</a> <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_graph">directed graph</a>
and then remove the direction information.</p>
<p>I will call an <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Undirected_graph#Undirected_graph">undirected
graph</a> <em>topologically ordered</em> if there is an orientation of
the edges such that the resulting directed graph is topologically
ordered. In other words, if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a
topologically ordered undirected graph if there is a topologically
ordered directed graph <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> such that
when we forget about the directions of the edges of <span
class="math inline">\(H\)</span> we get <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assume we already have a random tree <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(n-1\)</span> vertices. Pick a vertex <span
class="math inline">\(i\)</span> uniformly random, and connect an edge
<span class="math inline">\((i,n)\)</span> to form a new graph <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span>. Since <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> was a tree, it does not contain any
cycles. Since <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a new vertex
added to <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span>, the new graph <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> does not contain a cycle either.</p>
<p>As for the likelihood of our trees: There is only one tree on 2
vertices. So, picking a topologically ordered tree on 2 vertices by our
algorithm is uniformly random with probability 1. Now, assume by
induction that picking a topologically ordered tree on <span
class="math inline">\(n\&gt;1\)</span> vertices with the algorithm we
described above is uniformly random. Assume on the contrary that there
is a topologically ordered tree <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>
on <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> vertices which is more
likely to appear from our algorithm. We know that <span
class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is obtained from a topologically
ordered tree <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> on <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices by adding a single vertex
<span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> and a single edge <span
class="math inline">\((i,n+1)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span>. We also know that picking
an edge <span class="math inline">\((i,n+1)\)</span> is uniformly random
for <span class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span> with probability
<span class="math inline">\(\frac{1}{n}\)</span>. This means that <span
class="math display">\[ P(S) = \frac{P(T)}{n} \]</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> would have to appear more likely among
all topologically ordered trees on <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices. This is a contradiction.</p>
<h2 id="the-lisp-code">The Lisp Code</h2>
<p>The lisp code is pretty straightforward.</p>

   (loop for i from 1 below n 
         collect (list (random i) i)))
