<h1 id="latent-semantic-analysis-in-clojure">Latent Semantic Analysis in
Clojure</h1>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_analysis">Latent
Semantic Analysis</a> (LSA) is a very neat application of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Singular
Value Decomposition</a> (SVD) in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural
Language Processing</a> (NLP).</p>
<p>Let us start with declaring a namespace and importing stuff we
need.</p>
<pre><code>(ns lda
  (:import opennlp.tools.sentdetect.SentenceDetector
           opennlp.tools.sentdetect.SentenceDetectorME
           opennlp.tools.sentdetect.SentenceModel
           opennlp.tools.stemmer.PorterStemmer
           java.io.File)
  (:require [clojure.string :as st]
            [clatrix.core :as cc]))</code></pre>
<p>If you are running this at home, put a <code>deps.edn</code> file in
the directory you are going to run this and put the following inside the
file:</p>
<pre><code>{:deps {org.apache.opennlp/opennlp-tools {:mvn/version &quot;1.9.1&quot;}
        clatrix {:mvn/version &quot;0.5.0&quot;}}}</code></pre>
<p>In order to do what I need to do, I am going to need a sentence
detector which needs a pre-trained sentence model. You can find sentence
models needed at <a
href="http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/models-1.5/">OpenNLP’s
website</a>.</p>
<pre><code>(def detector (SentenceDetectorME. (SentenceModel. (File. &quot;resources/en-sent.bin&quot;))))</code></pre>
<p>A sentence detector extracts a sentence from a given text. This is
not a trivial task. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code>(def example-text &quot;This is a sentence with acronyms such as I.B.M. that can be used in combination with things like Mr. Smith, M.D. and Mrs. Smith, Ph.D.  And this is another sentence.&quot;)

(into [] (.sentDetect detector example-text))

#&#39;lda/example-text
[&quot;This is a sentence with acronyms such as I.B.M. that can be used in combination with things like Mr. Smith, M.D. and Mrs. Smith, Ph.D.&quot; &quot;And this is another sentence.&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>Next, I need a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemmer</a>. A stemmer is
a language specific tool that reduces a word to its root. OpenNLP has
several stemmers for the English language. One of the simplest ones is
the <a href="https://tartarus.org/martin/PorterStemmer/">Porter
Stemmer</a>.</p>
<pre><code>(def stemmer (PorterStemmer.))
   (-&gt;&gt; [&quot;triangulation&quot; &quot;contributing&quot; &quot;terminated&quot; &quot;trees&quot; &quot;deliciousness&quot;]
        (map #(.stem stemmer %))
        (into []))

#&#39;lda/stemmer
[&quot;triangul&quot; &quot;contribut&quot; &quot;termin&quot; &quot;tree&quot; &quot;delici&quot;]</code></pre>
<p>We are going to represent sentences as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">bags of
words</a>. In this representation, we disregard the word order and
consider a sentence just an unordered collection of words appearing in
that sentence. Let us write a function for that</p>
<pre><code>(defn bag-of-words [sentence stemmer stop-words]
   {sentence (as-&gt; sentence $
                   (st/lower-case $)
                   (st/replace $ #&quot;[^\s\p{Isletter}]&quot; &quot;&quot;)
                   (st/split $ #&quot;\s+&quot;)
                   (filter #(not (stop-words %)) $)
                   (map #(.stem stemmer %) $)
                   (into #{} $))})

#&#39;lda/bag-of-words</code></pre>
<p>The function takes a sentence, a stemmer and a collection of <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words">stop-words</a> and
returns a bag-of-words representation of the sentence. A stop word is a
word that appears so frequently in a text that it loses any significance
for the overall structure of a text. I am going to need a collection of
stop words which I already collected for an earlier project:</p>
<pre><code>(def stop-words
     (as-&gt; (slurp &quot;resources/remove-en&quot;) $
           (st/replace $ #&quot;\p{IsPunctuation}&quot; &quot;&quot;)
           (st/split $ #&quot;\s+&quot;)
           (into #{} $)))
stop-words

#&#39;lda/stop-words
#{&quot;else&quot; &quot;itself&quot; &quot;us&quot; &quot;more&quot; &quot;hers&quot; &quot;since&quot; &quot;isnt&quot; &quot;im&quot; &quot;got&quot; &quot;his&quot; &quot;him&quot; &quot;couldnt&quot; &quot;hadnt&quot; &quot;thing&quot; &quot;none&quot; &quot;are&quot; &quot;ive&quot; &quot;very&quot; &quot;under&quot; &quot;who&quot; &quot;which&quot; &quot;ones&quot; &quot;of&quot; &quot;this&quot; &quot;after&quot; &quot;once&quot; &quot;up&quot; &quot;off&quot; &quot;she&quot; &quot;among&quot; &quot;nor&quot; &quot;three&quot; &quot;youll&quot; &quot;two&quot; &quot;etc&quot; &quot;yours&quot; &quot;not&quot; &quot;hes&quot; &quot;every&quot; &quot;it&quot; &quot;over&quot; &quot;wouldnt&quot; &quot;however&quot; &quot;cant&quot; &quot;also&quot; &quot;by&quot; &quot;something&quot; &quot;is&quot; &quot;although&quot; &quot;why&quot; &quot;onto&quot; &quot;ever&quot; &quot;about&quot; &quot;they&quot; &quot;you&quot; &quot;thus&quot; &quot;without&quot; &quot;its&quot; &quot;than&quot; &quot;those&quot; &quot;where&quot; &quot;id&quot; &quot;just&quot; &quot;for&quot; &quot;should&quot; &quot;theres&quot; &quot;cannot&quot; &quot;my&quot; &quot;again&quot; &quot;yes&quot; &quot;whom&quot; &quot;because&quot; &quot;any&quot; &quot;most&quot; &quot;hed&quot; &quot;whether&quot; &quot;can&quot; &quot;were&quot; &quot;shell&quot; &quot;did&quot; &quot;was&quot; &quot;that&quot; &quot;if&quot; &quot;let&quot; &quot;both&quot; &quot;another&quot; &quot;always&quot; &quot;youve&quot; &quot;had&quot; &quot;must&quot; &quot;what&quot; &quot;oh&quot; &quot;an&quot; &quot;nothing&quot; &quot;even&quot; &quot;or&quot; &quot;youre&quot; &quot;have&quot; &quot;am&quot; &quot;their&quot; &quot;a&quot; &quot;so&quot; &quot;them&quot; &quot;didnt&quot; &quot;upon&quot; &quot;never&quot; &quot;many&quot; &quot;almost&quot; &quot;on&quot; &quot;but&quot; &quot;when&quot; &quot;until&quot; &quot;anything&quot; &quot;be&quot; &quot;hasnt&quot; &quot;out&quot; &quot;and&quot; &quot;whod&quot; &quot;do&quot; &quot;myself&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;shes&quot; &quot;here&quot; &quot;too&quot; &quot;one&quot; &quot;might&quot; &quot;between&quot; &quot;such&quot; &quot;youd&quot; &quot;how&quot; &quot;other&quot; &quot;from&quot; &quot;would&quot; &quot;wasnt&quot; &quot;these&quot; &quot;while&quot; &quot;no&quot; &quot;with&quot; &quot;around&quot; &quot;now&quot; &quot;some&quot; &quot;will&quot; &quot;himself&quot; &quot;all&quot; &quot;then&quot; &quot;could&quot; &quot;through&quot; &quot;has&quot; &quot;thats&quot; &quot;much&quot; &quot;being&quot; &quot;our&quot; &quot;dont&quot; &quot;shall&quot; &quot;before&quot; &quot;only&quot; &quot;your&quot; &quot;yet&quot; &quot;to&quot; &quot;into&quot; &quot;unless&quot; &quot;get&quot; &quot;may&quot; &quot;we&quot; &quot;as&quot; &quot;he&quot; &quot;me&quot; &quot;at&quot; &quot;the&quot; &quot;though&quot; &quot;theyre&quot; &quot;her&quot; &quot;theyd&quot; &quot;been&quot; &quot;there&quot; &quot;in&quot; &quot;shed&quot;}</code></pre>
<p>Let us test our <code>bag-of-words</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>(into {} (mapcat #(bag-of-words % stemmer stop-words) (into [] (.sentDetect detector example-text))))

{&quot;This is a sentence with acronyms such as I.B.M. that can be used in combination with things like Mr. Smith, M.D. and Mrs. Smith, Ph.D.&quot; #{&quot;us&quot; &quot;thing&quot; &quot;smith&quot; &quot;md&quot; &quot;like&quot; &quot;acronym&quot; &quot;phd&quot; &quot;sentenc&quot; &quot;ibm&quot; &quot;mr&quot; &quot;combin&quot;}, &quot;And this is another sentence.&quot; #{&quot;sentenc&quot;}}</code></pre>
<p>Now that we have bag-of-words representation, next we need to
construct a matrix from a text. The columns of the matrix are going to
be labeled with the sentences appearing in the text while the rows are
labeled with the words appearing in the sentence. The entries are going
to be either 0 or 1. For a (word, sentence) pair, the corresponding
entry in the matrix is 1 if the word appears in the sentence, and 0
otherwise. The interesting thing about this matrix <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is the following: If we look at <span
class="math inline">\(A^t A\)</span> we get a matrix whose rows and
columns are labeled with sentences appearing in our text. Each entry
labeled with a pair <span
class="math inline">\((sentence_1,sentence_2)\)</span> counts the number
of words common to both sentences. On the other hand, <span
class="math inline">\(A A^t\)</span> is another matrix whose rows and
columns are labeled with words and each entry labeled with a pair <span
class="math inline">\((word_1,word_2)\)</span> count the number of
sentences that these words appeared together.</p>
<p>In the next step we use <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">SVD</a>
to decompose the matrix as a product <span class="math display">\[ A =
U\Sigma V^t \]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\Sigma\)</span>
is a diagonal matrix consisting of singular values of <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Then the largest singular value
corresponds to the dominant topic of the document. From the point of
view of LDA, a topic is a probability distribution over the set of
words. So, we take the first column of the singular matrix as this
probability distribution below:</p>
<pre><code>(defn score [text detector stemmer stop-words]
   (let [ss (into [] (.sentDetect detector text))
         raw (into {} (mapcat #(bag-of-words % stemmer stop-words) ss))
         ws (-&gt;&gt; (vals raw) (reduce concat) (into #{}) (into []))
         n (count ss)
         m (count ws)
         A (cc/zeros m n)]
      (doseq [i (range n)]
         (doseq [w (get raw (nth ss i))]
            (cc/set A (.indexOf ws w) i 1)))
      (let [topic (-&gt; A cc/svd :left cc/cols first cc/t)]
         (map (fn [s v] {:sentence s :position (.indexOf ss s) :value (Math/abs (cc/dot v topic))}) ss (cc/cols A)))))

#&#39;lda/score</code></pre>
<p>Let us test:</p>
<pre><code>(def test-text (slurp &quot;data/textc&quot;))
(def res (score test-text detector stemmer stop-words))

#&#39;lda/test-text
#&#39;lda/res</code></pre>
<p>Here is a summary. For this one, I am displaying all those sentences
whose weights are greater than or equal to 2.2. One has to determine the
filter parameter heuristically for the text at hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Obama administration has backed down in its bitter dispute with
Silicon Valley over the encryption of data on iPhones and other digital
devices, concluding that it is not possible to give American law
enforcement and intelligence agencies access to that information without
also creating an opening that China, Russia, cybercriminals and
terrorists could exploit. With its decision, which angered the FBI and
other law enforcement agencies, the administration essentially agreed
with Apple, Google, Microsoft and a group of the nation’s top
cryptographers and computer scientists that millions of Americans would
be vulnerable to hacking if technology firms and smartphone
manufacturers were required to provide the government with “back doors,”
or access to their source code and encryption keys. In the paper,
released in July, Mr Neumann and other top cryptographers and computer
scientists argued that there was no way for the government to have a
back door into encrypted communications without creating an opening that
would be exploited by Chinese and Russian intelligence agents,
cybercriminals and terrorist groups. Mr Obama and his aides had come to
fear that the United States could set a precedent that China and other
nations would emulate, requiring Apple, Google and the rest of America’s
technology giants to provide them with the same access, officials said. 
According to government officials and industry executives, Mr Cook told
Mr Obama that the Chinese were waiting for an opportunity to seize on
administration action to insist that Apple devices, which are also
encrypted in China, be open to Beijing’s agents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Obama administration has backed down in its bitter dispute with
Silicon Valley over the encryption of data on iPhones and other digital
devices, concluding that it is not possible to give American law
enforcement and intelligence agencies access to that information without
also creating an opening that China, Russia, cybercriminals and
terrorists could exploit.</p>
<p>With its decision, which angered the FBI and other law enforcement
agencies, the administration essentially agreed with Apple, Google,
Microsoft and a group of the nation’s top cryptographers and computer
scientists that millions of Americans would be vulnerable to hacking if
technology firms and smartphone manufacturers were required to provide
the government with “back doors,” or access to their source code and
encryption keys.</p>
<p>Companies like Apple say they are protecting their customers’
information by resisting government demands for access to text messages.
A standoff has grown between the sides as the companies have embraced
tougher encryption. Peter G Neumann, a computer security pioneer, says
“there are more vulnerabilities than ever. Security experts like Richard
A. Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism czar, also signed the
letter to Obama. That would enable the government to see messages,
photographs and other data now routinely encrypted on smartphones.
Current technology puts the keys for access to the information in the
hands of the individual user, not the companies.</p>
<p>The first indication of the retreat came on Thursday, when the FBI
director, James B Comey, told the Senate Homeland Security and
Governmental Affairs Committee that the administration would not seek
legislation to compel the companies to create such a portal.</p>
<p>But the decision, made at the White House a week ago, goes
considerably beyond that.</p>
<p>While the administration said it would continue to try to persuade
companies like Apple and Google to assist in criminal and national
security investigations, it determined that the government should not
force them to breach the security of their products. In essence,
investigators will have to hope they find other ways to get what they
need, from data stored in the cloud in unencrypted form or transmitted
over phone lines, which are covered by a law that affects
telecommunications providers but not the technology giants.</p>
<p>Mr Comey had expressed alarm a year ago after Apple introduced an
operating system that encrypted virtually everything contained in an
iPhone. What frustrated him was that Apple had designed the system to
ensure that the company never held on to the keys, putting them entirely
in the hands of users through the codes or fingerprints they use to get
into their phones. As a result, if Apple is handed a court order for
data — until recently, it received hundreds every year — it could not
open the coded information.</p>
<p>Mr Comey compared that system to the creation of a door no law
officers could enter, or a car trunk they could not unlock. His concern
about what the FBI calls the “going dark” problem received support from
the director of the National Security Agency and other intelligence
officials.</p>
<p>But after a year of study and extensive White House debate, President
Obama and his advisers have reached a broad conclusion that an effort to
compel the companies to give the government access would fail, both
politically and technologically.</p>
<p>“This looks promising, but there’s still going to be tremendous
pressure from law enforcement,” said Peter G Neumann, one of the
nation’s leading computer scientists and a co-author of a paper that
examined the government’s proposal for special access. “The N.S.A. is
capable of dealing with the cryptography for now, but law enforcement is
going to have real difficulty with this. This is never a done deal.”</p>
<p>In the paper, released in July, Mr Neumann and other top
cryptographers and computer scientists argued that there was no way for
the government to have a back door into encrypted communications without
creating an opening that would be exploited by Chinese and Russian
intelligence agents, cybercriminals and terrorist groups.</p>
<p>Inside the White House, the Office of Science and Technology Policy
came largely to the same conclusion. Those determinations surprised the
FBI and local law enforcement officials, who had believed just months
ago that the White House would ultimately embrace their efforts.</p>
<p>The intelligence agencies were less vocal, which may reflect their
greater capability to search for and gather information. The National
Security Agency spends vast sums to get around digital encryption, and
it has tools and resources that local law enforcement officials still do
not have and most likely never will.</p>
<p>Disclosures by the former N.S.A. contractor Edward J. Snowden showed
the extent of the agency’s focus on cracking and circumventing the
encryption of digital communications, including those of Apple,
Facebook, Google and Yahoo users.</p>
<p>There were other motivations for the administration’s decision. Mr
Obama and his aides had come to fear that the United States could set a
precedent that China and other nations would emulate, requiring Apple,
Google and the rest of America’s technology giants to provide them with
the same access, officials said.</p>
<p>Timothy D Cook, the chief executive of Apple, sat at the head table
with Mr Obama and Xi Jinping, the Chinese president, at a state dinner
at the White House last month. According to government officials and
industry executives, Mr Cook told Mr Obama that the Chinese were waiting
for an opportunity to seize on administration action to insist that
Apple devices, which are also encrypted in China, be open to Beijing’s
agents.</p>
<p>In January, three months after Mr Comey began pressing companies for
special government access, Chinese officials had threatened to do just
that: They considered submitting foreign companies to invasive audits
and requiring them to build back doors into their hardware and software.
Those rules have not been put into effect.</p>
<p>The Obama administration’s position was also undercut by officials’
inability to keep their own data safe from Chinese hackers, as shown by
the extensive cyberattack at the Office of Personnel Management
discovered this year. That breach, and its aftermath, called into
question whether the government could keep the keys to the world’s
communications safe from its adversaries in cyberspace.</p>
<p>White House officials said they would continue trying to persuade
technology companies to help them in investigations, but they did not
specify how.</p>
<p>“As the president has said, the United States will work to ensure
that malicious actors can be held to account, without weakening our
commitment to strong encryption,” said Mark Stroh, a spokesman for the
National Security Council. “As part of those efforts, we are actively
engaged with private companies to ensure they understand the public
safety and national security risks that result from malicious actors’
use of their encrypted products and services. However, the
administration is not seeking legislation at this time.”</p>
<p>But here in Silicon Valley, executives did not think the government’s
announcement went far enough.</p>
<p>According to administration officials and technology executives, Mr
Cook of Apple has pressed the White House for a clear statement that it
will never seek a back door in any form, legislative or technical — a
statement he hoped to take to Beijing, Moscow and even London. Prime
Minister David Cameron of Britain has threatened to ban encrypted
devices and services, like the iPhone and Facebook’s popular WhatsApp
messaging service, but has done nothing so far to make good on that
threat.</p>
<p>Technology executives are determined to reassure customers abroad
that American intelligence agencies are not reading their digital
communications. It is an effort driven by economics: 64 percent of
Apple’s revenue originates overseas.</p>
<p>Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft argue that people put not only
their conversations but their entire digital lives — medical records,
tax returns, bank accounts — into a device that slips into their pocket.
While Mr Obama has repeatedly said he is sympathetic to the concerns of
law enforcement officials, he made clear during a visit to Silicon
Valley in February that he was also aware of privacy concerns and that
he sought to balance both interests.</p>
<p>Technologists responded that, with regard to encryption, no such
balance existed. “The real problem is, I don’t see any middle ground for
dumbing down everything to make special access possible and having the
secure systems we need for commerce, government and everything else,” Mr
Neumann said.</p>
