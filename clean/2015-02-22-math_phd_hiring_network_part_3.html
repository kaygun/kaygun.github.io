<h1 id="math-phd-hiring-network-part-3">Math PhD Hiring Network (Part
3)</h1>
<p>I have been looking at the hiring networks in Mathematics
(2015-02-18-math_phd_hiring_network_part_1.html) and <a
href="clean/2015-02-19-math_phd_hiring_network_part_2.html">here</a> in
the last two days. The resulting graphs are highly connected and
difficult to read. In order to perform more flexible analyses and to
simplify the workflow, I created another <a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/b287p69ossjewc6/all-named-edges.csv?dl=0">dataset</a>
which is easier to process, and I simplified the code that generates
these graphs.  You can find everything you need to play with the code
and the data <a
href="https://github.com/kaygun/hiring-network">here</a>.</p>
<p>The dataset now consists of person id, advisor’s school (name,
country and id) and recipient’s school (name, country and id) and year
of the degree. The code I wrote is bare bones. Depending on what you
want, first you need to filter the data and then pipe it to the program.
The command line parameters are</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The first item is either 0 for school based graphs or 1 for country
based graphs.</li>
<li>If the weight is below this threshold, it is not displayed on the
final graph.</li>
<li>The title of the graph for information purposed delimited with
quotation marks.</li>
</ol>
<p>The weight function: first all PhD’s are counted for the filtered
dataset. Then these numbers are normalized between 0 and 1. Then I apply
the following function: w(x)=log(1+x) to the result up to a suitable
scalar multiple and a cut off function.</p>
<h2 id="country-based-graphs">Country Based Graphs</h2>
<p>Let us start looking at the graphs again:</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fql82u2a6f5meev/countries-before-1800.svg?dl=0">Hiring
network before 1800</a></p>
<p>France, The Netherlands and Germany (then Prussia) dominated the Math
PhD network.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/830b78lm8ag1v2n/countries-1800-1910.svg?dl=0">Hiring
network between 1800 and 1910</a></p>
<p>The network has expanded, but the connections are not as strong as
before. Germany still dominates, and we have new players appearing on
the scene such as Russia and Ukraine. Also notice that both US and UK
are importers of PhD degrees, and Germany is the main exporter. But this
might be an inherent bias of the dataset. After all, Math Genealogy
Project is based in the US.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wru4t9bv4gul636/countries-1910-1940.svg?dl=0">Hiring
network between 1910 and 1940</a></p>
<p>The number of PhD’s among Germany, The Netherlands, Austria and
Switzerland expands. Russia starts exporting degrees to US. Also, notice
the relationship between Germany and Spain, but we see no discernible
relations between Germany and Italy in between two World Wars.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/wrm6rderurq8ex3/countries-1940-1985.svg?dl=0">Hiring
network between 1940 and 1985</a></p>
<p>Wow! Almost all PhD’s between 1940’s and 1980’s are given in the US.
The US looks like this large sink that swallows all the math PhD’s.
Also, notice that Russia’s influence expands. India now is visible, but
not China. </p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/vk7pwgzd5hh7158/countries-1985-2005.svg?dl=0">Hiring
network between 1985 and 2005</a></p>
<p>The US becomes the primary exporter of Math PhD’s. China shows up for
the first time. </p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fo5h6wblsypn3bh/countries-after-2005.svg?dl=0">Hiring
network after 2005</a></p>
<p>The US now dominating the scene. China appears on the horizon.</p>
<h2 id="school-based-graphs">School Based Graphs</h2>
<p>I will be looking at the specific network around the US, the UK and
Canada.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/zj79cauoq3ibbei/universities-1800-1910.svg?dl=0">Anglo-American
Network Between 1800–1910</a></p>
<p>The Math PhD Network of the US is very small and largely depends on
the UK and Germany.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/ny9y8uju7rbjm1w/universities-1910-1940.svg?dl=0">Anglo-American
Network Between 1910–1940</a></p>
<p>The network starts taking shape. The major hubs form: Chicago,
Harvard, Urbana-Champaign, Johns Hopkins and Princeton.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/x420xx05je4ylhu/universities-1940-1985.svg?dl=0">Anglo-American
Network Between 1940–1985</a></p>
<p>After US became the major importer of PhD degrees in math after the
2nd World War, major hubs form a tight network with some interesting
subnetworks on the periphery: Texas Austin and small cluster of Southern
Universities (not visible on this scale), New York University and its
small network, Cambridge and its cross-continental subnetwork.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/nc62m2td2ne4jjp/universities-1985-2005.svg?dl=0">Anglo-American
Network Between 1985–2005</a></p>
<p>I don’t know what it is but the PhD network became even more
connected than previous eras. Increasing and decreasing the threshold
doesn’t much change the structure of the graph. It is a highly connected
graph with plenty of connections between the major hubs and the rest of
the universities.</p>
<p><a
href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/d12sni6qtpw2a5e/universities-after-2005.svg?dl=0">Anglo-American
Network After 2005</a></p>
<p>The graph didn’t change much from the previous era.</p>
