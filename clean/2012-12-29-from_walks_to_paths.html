<h1 id="from-walks-to-paths">From walks to paths</h1>
<h2 id="description-of-the-problem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(G = (V,E)\)</span> is an
undirected graph. A <em>walk</em> in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a sequence of vertices <span
class="math inline">\((v_0,\ldots,v_n)\)</span> such that any two
consecutive vertices are connected by an edge. A <em>path</em>, on the
other hand, is a walk in which no edges are repeated consecutively. That
is <span class="math inline">\(v_{i-1}\)</span> is not the same as <span
class="math inline">\(v_{i+1}\)</span> whenever the indices make
sense.</p>
<p>Today, I will develop an algorithm which returns a path from a given
walk by deleting the unnecessary edges.</p>
<h2 id="an-algorithm">An algorithm</h2>
<p>Let me start with the pseudo-code of the algorithm. I will explain
what the algorithm does, and then prove its correctness.</p>
<pre><code>  Function Reduce
     Takes a sequence WALK of vertices as an input
     Returns a sequence PATH of vertices 
  Let PATH and AUX be empty sequences
  While WALK is not an empty sequence do
        If the new first vertex of WALK and the first vertex of PATH agree then
           Discard the first vertices of WALK, PATH and AUX
        Else
           Copy first the vertex of AUX to beginning of PATH
           Move the first vertex of WALK to the beginning of AUX
        End if
  End while
  Return the reverse of PATH</code></pre>
<p>It is easy to see that the time and space complexity of the reduction
algorithm are both <span class="math inline">\(O(n)\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the length of the walk fed into the
algorithm.</p>
<p>The main difference between a path and a walk is that a walk may
contain subsequences of the form <span
class="math inline">\(a,b,a\)</span> and we want to remove such
subsequences. Imagine our walk is <span
class="math inline">\((a,b,a)\)</span>, and we feed it to our algorithm.
After the first two runs we get</p>
<pre><code>  WALK = (a)
  PATH = (a)
  AUX = (b)</code></pre>
<p>and in the third run the sequence turns empty as we wanted. Of course
the unwanted sequences could be longer. I will handle the general case
by induction. Assume our algorithm removes all of the subsequences of
the form <span
class="math inline">\((a_1,\ldots,a_{n-1},a_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_1)\)</span>
which consists of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> edges, and
assume we feed a walk which consists of a subsequence <span
class="math inline">\((a_1,\ldots,a_n,a_{n+1},a_n,\ldots,a_1)\)</span>
which consists of <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> edges. When
our algorithm hits <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> at the top
of <code>WALK</code> there are three cases:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is possible that the vertex at the top of <code>PATH</code> is
the same as <span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> and we discard
<span class="math inline">\(a_1\)</span> together with the vertices at
the top of <code>PATH</code> and <code>AUX</code>, and the length of our
subsequence reduces by 1. The rest can be handled by the inductive
hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p>At any stage of the algorithm before we reach <span
class="math inline">\(a_{n+1}\)</span>, a reduction might occur in which
we have the same vertex appears at the top of <code>WALK</code> and
<code>PATH</code>. This means there is a short subsequence of the form
<span class="math inline">\((a,b,a)\)</span> within <code>WALK</code>.
Then the algorithm discards elements at the top of the lists
<code>WALK</code>, <code>PATH</code> and <code>AUX</code>. Then the
state now becomes indistinguishable from processing the sequence
<code>WALK</code> in which the subsequence <span
class="math inline">\((a,b,a)\)</span> is replaced by a single vertex
<span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. The rest can be handled by the
induction hypothesis.</p></li>
<li><p>The algorithm might continue without any reduction until we reach
<span class="math inline">\(a_{n+1}\)</span> and it moves at the top of
<code>AUX</code>. Then because we reached <span
class="math inline">\(a_{n+1}\)</span> without a reduction, <span
class="math inline">\(a_{n-1}\)</span> appears at the top of
<code>PATH</code> and <code>WALK</code>. So, we will have a reduction
and we can handle the rest by the induction hypothesis.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="an-implementation-in-lisp">An implementation in lisp</h2>
<p>For testing purposes I will use the following graph:</p>
<pre><code>(defparameter G &#39;((0 1) (1 2) (1 3) (2 3) (3 4)))</code></pre>
<figure data-orig-height="443" data-orig-width="119">
<img
src="../media/2012-12-29-from_walks_to_paths_0.png"
data-orig-height="443" data-orig-width="119" />
</figure>
<p>The function is as follows</p>
<pre><code>(defun from-walk-to-path (walk &amp;optional (path nil) (aux nil))
    (cond ((null walk) (reverse (cons (car aux) path)))
          ((null aux) (from-walk-to-path (cdr walk) 
                                         path 
                                         (cons (car walk) aux)))
          (t (let ((a (car walk))
                   (b (car path))
                   (c (car aux)))
                  (if (equal a b) 
                      (from-walk-to-path (cdr walk) 
                                         (cdr path) 
                                         (cdr aux))
                      (from-walk-to-path (cdr walk) 
                                         (cons c path) 
                                         (cons a aux)))))))</code></pre>
<p>Let us test our function on a proper path which requires no
reduction:</p>
<pre><code>(from-walk-to-path &#39;(0 1 2 3 4))
(0 1 2 3 4)</code></pre>
<p>Now, I will test it on two walks which require reduction.</p>
<pre><code>(from-walk-to-path &#39;(0 1 2 3 2 1 3 4 3 2 1))
(0 1 3 2 1)

(from-walk-to-path &#39;(0 1 2 3 2 1 3 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 4 3 1 3 4))
(0 1 2 3 4)</code></pre>
