<h1
id="experiments-with-infinite-recursive-sequences-continued">Experiments
with Infinite Recursive Sequences (continued)</h1>
<h2 id="descriptionoftheproblem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p>I was looking into working with potentially infinite recursive
sequences <a
href="2015-01-17-experiments_with_infinite_recursive_sequences.html">few
days ago</a>. The idea was that if we forgo an internal state, then
working with such a sequence amounts to having a recursive function with
a head, ie. not just the last element in the sequence but all of the
sequence we already constructed. The next element in the sequence
depended <em>only</em> on the head of the sequence. Using this, it was
easy to implement natural numbers, arithmetic progressions and even
Fibonacci sequence. The sequence of prime numbers as a recursive
sequence was a little work, but it can be done. I also wrote some
experimental code for filtering such sequences using predicates.</p>
<p>For implementing something like <code>map</code> or
<code>mapcar</code> I need something else. For today’s experiment, a
stream is a cons pair of two functions: an <em>iterator</em> which will
construct new elements on top of the head of the sequence and an
<em>extractor</em> which pulls a single element from the stream.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>If the extractor is going to pull the last element in the returned
sequence, this means no extra work is required. I am going to set it to
<code>nil</code> as the default case as in the case of natural numbers
or any arithmetic progression:</p>
<pre><code>(defvar natural
   (cons (lambda (x)
            (if (null x)
               (list 0)
               (cons (1+ (car x)) x)))
         nil))
NATURAL

(defun arithmetic-progression (a b)
   (cons (lambda (x)
            (if (null x)
               (list b)
               (cons (+ a (car x)) x)))
         nil))
ARITHMETIC-PROGRESSION</code></pre>
<p>Even with the Fibonacci sequence, or with the sequence of prime
numbers the extractor is trivial.</p>
<pre><code>(defvar fibonacci
   (cons (lambda (x)
            (cond ((null x) (list 1))
                  ((&lt; (length x) 2) (cons 1 x))
              (t (cons (+ (car x) (cadr x)) x))))
         nil))
FIBONACCI

(defvar prime
   (cons (lambda (x)
            (cond ((null x) (list 2))
                  ((= (car x) 2) (cons 3 x))
                  (t (let ((y (reverse x))
                           (m (1+ (floor (sqrt (car x))))))
                        (do ((i (+ (car x) 2) (+ i 2)))
                            ((do ((j y (cdr j)))
                                 ((or (&gt; (car j) m)
                                      (zerop (mod i (car j))))
                                  (&gt; (car j) m)))
                             (cons i x)))))))
         nil))
PRIME</code></pre>
<p>This change will require me to modify the <code>take</code> function
using extractors:</p>
<pre><code>(defun s-take (stream n &amp;optional (head nil))
   (destructuring-bind
         (iterate . extract) stream
      (do* ((i n (1- i))
            (run head (funcall iterate run))
            (res nil (and extract (cons (funcall extract run) res))))
           ((zerop i) (or res run)))))
S-TAKE</code></pre>
<p>The variable <code>res</code> holds part of the data we want to
extract from the stream if the <code>extractor</code> is not
<code>nil</code>. Now, you can see why I set the extractor to
<code>nil</code>. I could also use <code>car</code> but by doing so both
<code>run</code> and <code>res</code> do contain the same elements.
Twice the memory for no gain.</p>
<p>Let us test the streams we defined above:</p>
<pre><code>(s-take natural 10)
(9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0)

(s-take (arithmetic-progression 13 4) 10)
(121 108 95 82 69 56 43 30 17 4)

(s-take prime 10)
(29 23 19 17 13 11 7 5 3 2)</code></pre>
<p>The <code>s-take</code> function that I wrote above is a special kind
of a reducer which uses <code>cons</code> as the aggregator. We can
replace it with any two to one function
<code>fn:T -&gt; T -&gt; T</code></p>
<pre><code>(defun s-reduce (stream n &amp;optional (fn #&#39;cons) head)
   (let ((iterate (car stream))
         (extract (or (cdr stream) #&#39;car)))
      (do* ((i n (1- i))
            (run head (funcall iterate run))
            (res nil (funcall fn (funcall extract run) res)))
           ((zerop i) res))))
S-REDUCE</code></pre>
<p>Now, let me test it to calculate 10!. For that I am going to need the
first 10 natural numbers starting at 1 (hence <code>(list 1)</code>
argument) and the aggregator is the product. But before I do that I must
guarantee that <code>nil</code> arguments are turned into the unit of
the product (hence <code>(or x 1)</code> and <code>(or y 1)</code>
arguments)</p>
<pre><code>(s-reduce
   natural
   9
   (lambda (x y) (* (or x 1) (or y 1)))
   (list 1))
3628800</code></pre>
<h2 id="filteringasequence">Filtering a sequence</h2>
<p>As for filtering, now I have:</p>
<pre><code>(defun s-filter (stream &amp;rest preds)
  (let* ((iterate (car stream))
         (extract (or (cdr stream) #&#39;car)))
    (cons (lambda (x)
             (do* ((y (funcall iterate x) (funcall iterate y))
                   (z (funcall extract y) (funcall extract y)))
                  ((every (lambda (pred) (funcall pred z)) preds) y)))
          extract)))
S-FILTER</code></pre>
<p>This time around, one can send a sequence of predicates and we will
filter the stream using all of the predicates.</p>
<pre><code>(defun primep (n)
  (cond
     ((&lt; n 2) nil)
     ((= n 2) t)
     ((evenp n) nil)
     (t (let ((m (floor (sqrt n))))
           (do ((i 3 (+ i 2)))
               ((or (zerop (mod n i)) (&gt; i m))
                (&gt; i m)))))))

<h2 id="mappinganinfinitestream">Mapping an infinite stream</h2>
<p>Now, with streams with extractors (an idea I already used in
filtering) mapping becomes easy:</p>
<pre><code>(defun s-map (stream &amp;rest fns)
  (cons (car stream)
        (lambda (x)
           (let ((y (funcall (or (cdr stream) #&#39;car) x)))
              (dolist (fn fns y)
                 (setf y (funcall fn y)))))))
S-MAP</code></pre>
<p>The mapping functions do not alter the iterator. Instead, we compose
them one by one with the current extractor. As with filter, I am going
to send a sequence of functions and they will be applied to the stream
<em>from left to right</em>.</p>
<pre><code>(defun binary-palindrome-p (n)

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>
<p>What I wrote above is heavily influenced by what Rich Hickey did with
<a href="http://clojure.org/reducers">reducers</a> and <a
href="http://clojure.org/transducers">transducers</a>. But this all came
out from reading <a
href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node70.html">SICP’s
streams</a>. I was thinking of constructing primes as a stream. It came
to me that it would be easier, and perhaps conceptually clearer, to
construct streams as recursive functions that depend only on the head of
the stream. To be clear: when I say <em>the head</em> I mean the whole
initial segment <span
class="math inline">\((a_n,a_{n-1},\ldots,a_1)\)</span> of the stream,
not just the last element <span class="math inline">\(a_n\)</span>. This
way, the stream can also be functional, that is, whoever has the head
has also the next element. With clever use of memoization, there would
be no collisions, no blocking, no semaphores, no nothing.</p>
<p>To be fair, there are a couple of things missing in my
implementation. For example, this approach is good for infinite
sequences, but I need a way of signaling that a stream has reached its
end if it happens to be a finite sequence. This can be done via
returning multiple values in the extractor: one value and one boolean
(<code>t</code> when the end is reached, and <code>nil</code>
otherwise). Then all of the functions I wrote above need to be corrected
accordingly.</p>
