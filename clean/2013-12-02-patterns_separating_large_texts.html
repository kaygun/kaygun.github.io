<h1 id="patterns-separating-large-texts">Patterns Separating Large
Texts</h1>
<h2 id="descriptionoftheproblem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p><a
href="clean/2013-11-11-entropy_and_approximately_one-to-one_maps.html">The
other day</a>, I was looking at a problem of pattern matching.
Specifically, I was thinking about what parts of a pattern is most
significant when trying to match it against a large set of strings. <a
href="clean/2013-11-11-entropy_and_approximately_one-to-one_maps.html">The
solution I gave</a> used entropy, much of the same way decision trees
use entropy but instead of minimizing entropy I chose the maximization
route.</p>
<p>In that problem I had one luxury: the strings (both the pattern
string and the strings in the set) had a beginning and an end. In cases
like genome sequences this is one luxury we don’t have. Plus there are
the problems of mutations, insertions and deletions. An exact match is
usually not the thing one wants. I guess the success of <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST">BLAST</a>, or <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitap_algorithm">BITAP</a> type
algorithms and their variations, comes from the fact that these are
<em>fast approximate matching</em> algorithms.<a href="#fn:note"
id="fnref:note" class="footnote">1</a></p>
<p>So, today I will consider another matching problem: I were to find a
specific pattern (preferably large) to match against a large set of
large strings, which part of the pattern should I choose to match
against the large set?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a large pattern and even larger string, or set of strings, to
match which part, or parts, of the string should I choose to maximize my
chances of a total match?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let me make this clear: this is not an alternative to fast
approximate search algorithms such as <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAST">BLAST</a>, but rather a
complement by helping us to choose a specific part of the pattern to
match against the large set of strings.</p>
<h2 id="thedelimiters">The delimiters</h2>
<p>Assume we have an alphabet consisting of letters <span
class="math inline">\(a_0,a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span> and a language which
uses this alphabet to form its vocabulary and sentences. Assume that the
language uses <span class="math inline">\(a_0\)</span> as the delimiter
to delineate the beginnings and the ends of each word. What is the
expected value of the length of a word in this language? This is a nice
small problem I need to understand before I embark on solving the other
problem.</p>
<p>Each language (human or otherwise) has a specific distribution of
characters (assuming the languages we compare use the same set of
characters). Assume <span
class="math inline">\(p_0,p_1,\ldots,p_n\)</span> be the probabilities
of seeing the characters <span class="math inline">\(a_0,
a_1,\ldots,a_n\)</span> respectively. Then the expected length is the
result from an infinite series: <span class="math display">\[ E(\ell) =
\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty \ell (1-p_0)^\ell p_0 \]</span> The sum can be
obtained from the power series <span class="math display">\[ x(1-x)
\frac{d}{dx}\sum_{\ell=0}^\infty x^\ell =
x(1-x)\frac{d}{dx}\frac{1}{1-x} = \frac{x}{1-x} \]</span> by
substituting <span class="math inline">\(1-p_0\)</span> for <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. Thus <span class="math display">\[
E(\ell) = \frac{1-p_0}{p_0} =
\left(\frac{1}{p_0}-1\right) \]</span></p>
<h2 id="experimentwithmarktwain">Experiment with Mark Twain</h2>
<p>First let me do a small experiment with a text from English.</p>
<p>Below, I will find the character distributions form the texts
“Adventures of Tom Sawyer” and “Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” by Mark
Twain. The first function processes the text file:</p>
<pre><code>(defun character-distribution (file)
   (let ((hash (make-hash-table)))
      (with-open-file (in file :direction :input)
         (do ((line (read-line in nil) (read-line in nil)))
             ((null line) hash)
           (map nil 
                (lambda (x) (setf (gethash x hash) (1+ (gethash x hash 0))))
                (string-downcase line))))))

CHARACTER-DISTRIBUTION</code></pre>
<p>And the function that calculates the probabilities:</p>
<pre><code>(defun experiment (distribution myfilter)
   (let ((n 0)
         (probs nil))

      (maphash 
         (lambda (x y) (if (funcall myfilter x) (incf n y)))
         distribution)

      (maphash 
         (lambda (x y) (push (cons x (/ y n 1.0d0)) probs)) 
         distribution)

      (cons 
         n 
         (remove-if-not 
             (lambda (x) (funcall myfilter (car x)))
             (sort probs (lambda (x y) (&gt; (cdr x) (cdr y))))))))

EXPERIMENT</code></pre>
<p>I will need a filter function will drop all characters other than ‘a’
to 'z’ or space. Then we perform the test on the text I chose:</p>
<pre><code>(defvar text-result 
          (experiment 
             (character-distribution &quot;../data/twain-tom-sawyer.txt&quot;)
             (lambda (x) (or (char= x #\Space) (char&lt;= #\a x #\z)))))
