</blockquote>
<p>As a mathematician, the joke is still lost on me. As a matter of fact
I said the very same thing to myself when I first heard about the use of
monads in computer science and then saw the torrent of posts and
explanations on the subject on the <a
href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Monad_tutorials_timeline">interwebs</a>.
As I understand it, one reason why they are used is because functional
languages such as Haskell mostly shun side effects and monads are seen
as one possible method to manipulate/simulate/keep track of side
effects. I am <strong>not</strong> going to comment on that.
(<strong>Addendum:</strong> Here is <a
href="http://scienceblogs.com/goodmath/2007/01/31/the-theory-of-monads-and-the-m-1/">another
exposition</a> I really like on the subject.)</p>
<p>Today, I will dig into three notions with examples from common
lisp:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Higher order functions</li>
<li>Functors</li>
<li>Monads</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="higher-order-functions">Higher order functions</h2>
<p>Anyone who has some experience with a functional programming language
would know that what separates this class of languages is the relative
ease of passing functions as arguments to other functions. Such
functions which accept other functions as arguments are called
<strong>higher order functions</strong>. The standard <a
href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/Groups/AI/html/cltl/clm/node90.html"><code>mapcar</code></a>
is such an example from common lisp. Here is another example:</p>
<pre><code>(defun compose (f g)
     (lambda (x) (funcall f (funcall g x))))
COMPOSE</code></pre>
<p>This function takes two lisp functions and returns a new function
which is obtained by composing its arguments.</p>
<pre><code>(defparameter new (compose (lambda (x) (* x x)) &#39;1+))
NEW</code></pre>
<p>This function <code>new</code> is the mathematical function <span
class="math inline">\(f(x) = (x + 1)^2\)</span> written as a composition
of an anonymous function and the standard lisp function <code>1+</code>.
Let us test if it works as intended:</p>
<pre><code>(loop for i from 1 to 10 collect (let ((x (random 9))) (cons x (funcall new x))))
((4 . 25) (3 . 16) (2 . 9) (5 . 36) (1 . 4) (6 . 49) (5 . 36) (1 . 4)
 (1 . 4) (2 . 9))</code></pre>
<h2 id="functors">Functors</h2>
<p>A <strong>functor</strong> is a higher order function which is
compatible with composition. Mathematically speaking, a higher order
function <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a functor when for
two composable ordinary functions <span class="math inline">\(g\colon
X\to Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f\colon Y\to Z\)</span>
one has <span class="math display">\[ F(f\circ g) = F(f)\circ F(g)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> denotes the
binary operation of composition. I will give a non-example, and then an
example.</p>
<p>Consider the following higher order function</p>
<pre><code>(defun twice (f) (lambda (x) (* 2 (funcall f x))))
TWICE</code></pre>
<p>which takes a numerical function as an argument and returns another
numerical function whose return value is twice of the argument function.
This is <strong>not</strong> a functor because the functions
<code>(twice (compose f g))</code> and
<code>(compose (twice f) (twice g))</code> need not return the same
value when called with the same argument. For example take the identity
function which returns its argument as is</p>
<pre><code>(defun id (x) x)
ID</code></pre>
<p>and then compare these functions at some random point</p>
<pre><code>(funcall (twice (compose &#39;id &#39;id)) 10)
20</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>(funcall (compose (twice &#39;id) (twice &#39;id)) 10)
40</code></pre>
<p>These values are not the same. So, <code>twice</code> is a higher
order function but not a functor.</p>
<p>Now, consider the following higher order function
<code>vectorize</code></p>
<pre><code>(defun vectorize (f) (lambda (x) (mapcar f x)))
VECTORIZE</code></pre>
<p>which takes a function <span class="math inline">\(f:X\to Y\)</span>
as an argument which operates some type of input <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to create an output of type <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>, and promotes it to another function
<code>(vectorize f)</code> which takes a list of objects of type <span
class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to create list of objects of type <span
class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>. For example</p>
<pre><code>(funcall (vectorize &#39;1+) &#39;(0 1 2 3))
(1 2 3 4)</code></pre>
<p>This higher order function is compatible with composition of
functions.</p>
<pre><code>(defun LHS (f g) (vectorize (compose f g)))
LHS</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>(defun RHS (f g) (compose (vectorize f) (vectorize g)))
RHS</code></pre>
<p>are going to produce the same effect on every pair of composable
functions. For example consider the following random list of
integers</p>
<pre><code>(defparameter some-list (loop for i from 1 to 10 collect (random 10)))
SOME-LIST</code></pre>
<p>Now we compare <code>LHS</code> and <code>RHS</code> on this list</p>
<pre><code>(funcall (rhs (lambda (x) (* x x)) &#39;1+) some-list)
(36 9 4 81 100 25 81 64 81 25)</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>(funcall (lhs (lambda (x) (* x x)) &#39;1+) some-list)
(36 9 4 81 100 25 81 64 81 25)</code></pre>
<p>Of course, seeing <code>RHS</code> and <code>LHS</code> producing the
same output on some random list does not guarantee that <code>RHS</code>
and <code>LHS</code> will produce the same output for all inputs but
think for few seconds you will see that they should be the same. In
other words, you will convince yourself that <code>vectorize</code> is a
functor.</p>
<p>If you think that functors are completely theoretical constructs and
devoid of any <em>real-life</em> applications in every day computing,
think again: imagine you have a file <code>data.csv</code> consisting of
two columns of numbers and you need the sums of the first column and the
second column and written on the third column.<br />
I would use a awk one liner</p>
<pre><code>awk &#39;{ print $1 &quot;\t&quot; $2 &quot;\t&quot; ($1+$2); }&#39; data.csv</code></pre>
<p>and voila! What you should realize now is that you used a functor
similar to <code>vectorize</code> I defined above :)</p>
<h2 id="functors-and-type-signatures-of-functions">Functors and type
signatures of functions</h2>
<p>There is another aspect of functors I did not get into above. Yes, a
functor operates on a function and give you another function, and yes it
is also compatible with the composition of function. But what about the
type signatures of the functions? A functor <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> might transform the type signatures of
the functions but it should do it without altering the composability of
the functions. If <span class="math inline">\(f\colon Y\to Z\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(g\colon X\to Y\)</span> is a composable
pair of functions with their respective type signatures, then the
resulting functions <span class="math inline">\(T(f)\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(T(g)\)</span> should have compatible type
signatures as well. We mathematicians write the resulting type
signatures as <span class="math inline">\(T(f)\colon T(Y)\to
T(Z)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(T(g)\colon T(X)\to
T(Y)\)</span>.</p>
<p>So, for the <code>vectorize</code> example above if we were to given
a function of type <code>g:: Int -&gt; Char</code> then the resulting
function <code>vectorize(g)</code> would have the type signature
<code>vectorize(g):: [Int] -&gt; [Char]</code> (Here I am using Haskell
notations and conventions.) And if have another function
<code>f:: Char -&gt; String</code> then <code>vectorize(f)</code> will
produce a function with the type signature
<code>vectorize(f):: [Char] -&gt; [String]</code> without altering
composability of <code>f</code> and <code>g</code>.</p>
<h2 id="monads">Monads</h2>
<p>OK, so you know that a monad is a monoid in the category of
endofunctors. But what does that even mean?</p>
<p>First of all a monad <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a
functor. The “endo” part indicates that the type signature of <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> itself (it is a higher order function
afterall, and therefore has its own type signature) is special. It must
be of the form <span class="math inline">\(T\colon A\to A\)</span>. I
would have a hard time describing this in Haskell. In lisp lingo I would
say <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> sends a lambda expression to
another lambda expression. I suppose I can write
<code>T: lambda -&gt; lambda</code>. As such, one can compose <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> with itself many times. So, we can look
at the whole sequence of lambda expressions <span
class="math inline">\(T^n(f)\)</span>. If <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is a monoid (i.e. a monad) in this
context then we have an extra piece of information to tell us how to
flatten these iterated objects <span
class="math inline">\(T^n(f)\)</span> consistently to level of <span
class="math inline">\(T(f)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let me explain this on the <code>vectorize</code> example I defined
above. If <code>f</code> is a function of type signature
<code>f:Int -&gt; Char</code> then <code>(vectorize f)</code> sends
lists of integers to lists of characters
<code>[Int] -&gt; [Char]</code>. Now imagine you applied
<code>vectorize</code> twice. The new function you get
<code>(vectorize (vectorize f))</code> will operate on a list of lists
of integers and will produce a list of lists of characters
<code>[[Int]] --&gt; [[Char]]</code>. In this case the consistency
requirement is as follows: Consider the generic function
<code>flatten:[[a]]-&gt;[a]</code> which takes a nested list and
flattens it. Then we ask that the resulting list from</p>
<pre><code>(flatten (funcall (vectorize (vectorize &#39;f)) my-list-of-lists))</code></pre>
<p>and from</p>
<pre><code>(funcall (vectorize &#39;f) (flatten my-list-of-lists))</code></pre>
<p>should be the same list of characters for any list of lists of
integers <code>my-list-of-lists</code>.</p>
<p>I will give just a simple example:</p>
<pre><code>(defun flatten (x)
    (cond ((null x) nil)
          ((atom x) (list x))
          (t (mapcan &#39;flatten x))))

(defun f (x) (+ (* x x) x 1))

(defparameter my-list-of-lists
    (mapcar (lambda (n) (loop for i from 0 to n collect (random 12)))
            (loop for i from 1 to 5 collect (1+ (random 7)))))

my-list-of-lists
((4 1 9 3 3) (9 3 11 2) (11 1 6 4 6) (2 6 5 4 7 1) (1 1 7 8 5 11 1 10))</code></pre>
<p>Now, we calculate</p>
<pre><code>(flatten (funcall (vectorize (vectorize &#39;f)) my-list-of-lists))
(21 3 91 13 13 91 13 133 7 133 3 43 21 43 7 43 31 21 57 3 3 3 57 73 31 133 3 111)</code></pre>
<p>and</p>
<pre><code>(funcall (vectorize &#39;f) (flatten my-list-of-lists))
(21 3 91 13 13 91 13 133 7 133 3 43 21 43 7 43 31 21 57 3 3 3 57 73 31 133 3 111)</code></pre>
<p>We call such pairs <code>(vectorize,flatten)</code> as monads. You
need an endofunctor <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> and a generic
function <span class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span> which
<em>flattens</em> <span class="math inline">\(T^2\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> in such a way that any sort of
potentially different flattenings of higher order terms <span
class="math inline">\(T^n\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(T\)</span> via any use of consecutive <span
class="math inline">\(\eta\)</span>’s produce the same effect.</p>
