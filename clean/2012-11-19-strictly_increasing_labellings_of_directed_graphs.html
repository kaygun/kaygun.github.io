<h1 id="strictly-increasing-labellings-of-directed-graphs">Strictly
Increasing Labellings of Directed Graphs</h1>
<h2 id="description-of-the-problem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(G = (V,E)\)</span> is a directed
graph with no oriented cycles. Today, I would like to show that one can
label the vertices of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> in such a
way <span class="math inline">\(\phi\colon V\to \mathbb{N}\)</span> that
(1) <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is one-to-one and (2) on
every path <span class="math inline">\((v_0,\ldots,v_n)\)</span> in
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> the labels are stricly increasing
<span
class="math inline">\(\phi(v_0)&lt;\cdots&lt;\phi(v_n)\)</span>.</p>
<h2 id="a-solution">A Solution</h2>
<p>Before venturing in solving this problem, let me start with a simple
lemma I am going to need later:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every cycle-free finite directed graph <span class="math inline">\(G
= (V,E)\)</span> contains at least one source and one sink.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will give a proof for the source case. The proof for the existence
of a sink is similar. Take an arbitrary vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v_0\in V\)</span>. If it is a source, we are done.
If <span class="math inline">\(v_0\)</span> is not a source then there
is another vertex <span class="math inline">\(v_1\in
V\setminus\{v_0\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\((v_1,v_0)\)</span> is a directed edge. Proceed
inductively and form a sequence <span class="math inline">\(v_{n+1}\in
V\setminus \{v_n\}\)</span> such that <span
class="math inline">\((v_{i+1},v_i)\)</span> is a directed edge. Since
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is finite, this process can not
continue indefinitely. There are two possibilities: either we got a
source at some step and we stop, or we got a repetition: we find <span
class="math inline">\(v_i=v_j\)</span> for some <span
class="math inline">\(i\&gt;j\)</span>. But the latter case is a
contradiction as there are no oriented cycles. So, the process must end
with a source.</p>
<p>I will solve the original question using induction on the number of
vertices. Assume <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has only one
vertex. The problem is trivial as the only path is the trival path of
length 0 on the single vertex. So, assume in every cycle-free directed
graph on <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices the statement
is true. Take a graph on <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>
vertices. We know because of the lemma that there is a source. Take such
a source <span class="math inline">\(s\in V\)</span> and remove <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span> from the graph together with all edges
starting at <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. The remaining graph
<span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span> contains <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> vertices and has no oriented cycles
like <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Then because of the
induction hypothesis we can find a one-to-one labelling <span
class="math inline">\(\psi\colon V\setminus\{s\}\to \mathbb{N}\)</span>
such that on every path in <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>
the labels are strictly increasing. Now define <span
class="math inline">\(\phi\colon V\to \mathbb{N}\)</span> by letting
<span class="math inline">\(\phi(s) = 1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(v) = \psi(v) + 2\)</span> if <span
class="math inline">\(v\neq s\)</span>.</p>
<p>Assume <span class="math inline">\(\phi(v)=\phi(w)\)</span> for some
vertices in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. There are two cases:
(1) either one of these vertices is <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>, or (2) <span
class="math inline">\(v,w\in V\setminus\{s\}\)</span>. In the first case
assume without loss of generality that <span
class="math inline">\(v=s\)</span> then <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(v)=1=\phi(w)\)</span>. This will yield <span
class="math inline">\(w=s\)</span> as well because in this labelling the
only vertex with the label <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is
<span class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. In the second case <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(v) = \psi(v)+2 = \psi(w)+2 = \phi(w)\)</span>
since neither elements are the source <span
class="math inline">\(s\)</span>. Then we get <span
class="math inline">\(v=w\)</span> as <span
class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> was one-to-one. This finishes the
proof that <span class="math inline">\(\phi\)</span> is one-to-one.</p>
<p>As for the fact that labels are stricly increasing on every path,
take an arbitrary path <span
class="math inline">\((v_0,\ldots,v_n)\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. There are two cases: (1) <span
class="math inline">\(v_0=s\)</span> and (2) <span
class="math inline">\(v_0\neq s\)</span>. In the first case <span
class="math inline">\(v_0 = s\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(\phi(v_i)=\psi(v_i)+2\)</span> for all <span
class="math inline">\(i=1,\ldots,n\)</span> and since <span
class="math inline">\(\psi\)</span> is strictly increasing on every path
in <span class="math inline">\(G&#39;\)</span>, we must have <span
class="math display">\[ 1 =
\phi(v_0)&lt;\psi(v_1)+2&lt;\cdots&lt;\psi(v_n)+2 \]</span> In the
second case <span class="math inline">\(\phi(v_i)=\psi(v_i)+2\)</span>
for all <span class="math inline">\(i=0,\ldots,n\)</span> and therefore
<span class="math display">\[ \phi(v_1) = \psi(v_1) + 2 &lt; \psi(v_2) +
2 &lt;\cdots&lt;
\psi(v_n) + 2 \]</span> This finishes the proof.</p>
