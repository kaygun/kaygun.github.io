<h1 id="document-summarization-via-markov-chains">Document Summarization
via Markov Chains</h1>
<h2 id="description-of-the-problem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p>Today’s question is this: we have a long text and we want a machine
generated summary of the text. Below, I will describe an algorithmic and
language agnostic method to do just that.</p>
<h2 id="sentences-overlaps-and-markov-chains.">Sentences, overlaps and
Markov chains.</h2>
<p>In my <a
href="clean/2015-10-07-computational_literary_analysis.html">previous
post</a> I described a method to measure the overlap between two
sentences in terms of common words. Today, we will use the same measure,
or a variation, to develop a <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">discrete Markov
chain</a> whose nodes are labeled by individual sentences appearing in
our text. This is essentially <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank">page rank</a> applied to
sentences.</p>
<pre><code>Algorithm SentenceRank
Input: T text to be summarized, L a real number parameter 
Output: ST summary of the text
Begin
  Split the text into an ordered sequence S of sentences.
  Convert each sentence into a hash map where keys are
     the (stemmed) words appearing in each sentence, and the 
     values are the number of times that particular key 
     appear in the sentence. Store the results in SH.
  Let A be a |SH|x|SH| matrix initialized to 0.
  For each a in SH do
      For each b in SH do
          Let A(a,b) be the overlap measure of a and b
      End for
  End for
  Normalize each column of A so that sum(A(.,b))=1 for each b
  Calculate v the unique 1-eigen-vector of A
  Let ST be the empty ordered sequence ()
  For each a in S do
      If the value v(a)*|S|&gt;L then add a to ST
  End for
  Return ST
End</code></pre>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>I am going to recycle most of the code from my <a
href="clean/2015-10-07-computational_literary_analysis.html">previous
post</a></p>
<pre><code>(defun slurp (filename)
   (with-open-file (input filename :direction :input)
      (do* ((line (read-line input nil) (read-line input nil))
            (res line (concatenate &#39;string res &quot; &quot; line)))
           ((null line) res))))
SLURP

(defun merge-with (fn &amp;rest xs)
   (let ((res nil))
      (dolist (x (reduce #&#39;append xs) res)
         (let ((val (cdr (assoc (car x) res :test #&#39;equal))))
             (if (null val)
                (push x res)
                (rplacd (assoc (car x) res :test #&#39;equal)
                        (funcall fn val (cdr x))))))))
MERGE-WITH

(defmacro -&gt;&gt; (x &amp;rest forms)
  (dolist (f forms x)
     (if (listp f)
        (setf x (append f (list x)))
        (setf x (list f x)))))
-&gt;&gt;

(defun clean (str)

CLEAN</code></pre>
<p>I am going to modify the code that converts a sentence into a hash
table, because I am also going to need the sentence itself for
later.</p>
<pre><code>(defun bag-of-words (text &amp;optional (threshold 80))
   (if (&gt; (length text) threshold)
      (cons (-&gt;&gt; text
                 (ppcre:split &quot;\s+&quot;)
                 (mapcar (lambda (x) (cons (stem:stem x) 1)))
                 (merge-with #&#39;+))
            text)))
BAG-OF-WORDS</code></pre>
<p>Now, the similarity, or the overlap measure:</p>
<pre><code>(defun dot (a b)
   (labels ((loc (x) (or (cdr x) 0.0))
            (len (x) (reduce #&#39;+ x :key #&#39;cdr :initial-value 0)))
      (let ((keys (mapcar #&#39;car (append a b)))
            (res  0.0d0))
         (dolist (x keys (/ res (min (len a) (len b))))
            (incf res (* (loc (assoc x a :test #&#39;equal))
                      (loc (assoc x b :test #&#39;equal))))))))
DOT</code></pre>
<p>Next up is the code that process a document and returns a list of
triples <code>(x y z)</code> where <code>z</code> is a sentence
appearing in the text, <code>x</code> is the position of the sentence
<code>z</code> in the text, and <code>y</code> is the measure telling
how significant a sentence is in this document.</p>
<pre><code>(defun proc (text)
   (let* ((res (-&gt;&gt; (clean text)
                    (ppcre:split &quot;[\.:;?!]\s+&quot;)
                    (mapcar #&#39;bag-of-words)
                    (remove-if #&#39;null)))
          (n (length res))
          (sents (make-array n :initial-contents (mapcar #&#39;cdr res)))
          (bags  (make-array n :initial-contents (mapcar #&#39;car res)))
          (matrix (grid:make-foreign-array
                   &#39;double-float
                   :dimensions (list n n)
                   :initial-element 0.0d0)))

   (dotimes (i n)
      (dotimes (j (- n i))
         (let ((val (dot (aref bags i) (aref bags (+ i j)))))
            (setf (grid:aref matrix i (+ j i)) val)
            (setf (grid:aref matrix (+ j i) i) val))))

   (dotimes (i n)
      (let* ((l1 (reduce #&#39;+ (grid:column matrix i))))
         (dotimes (j n)
            (setf (grid:aref matrix j i)
                  (/ (abs (grid:aref matrix j i)) l1)))))

   (multiple-value-bind (val vec)
         (gsll:eigenvalues-eigenvectors-nonsymm matrix)
      (let* ((probs (grid:column vec 0 (make-array n)))
             (sum (reduce (lambda (x y) (+ (abs x) (abs y))) probs)))
         (map &#39;list 
              (lambda(x y) (cons (* (/ (abs x) sum) n) y)) 
              probs 
              sents)))))
PROC</code></pre>
<p>And finally the main function:</p>
<pre><code>(let* ((filename (nth 1 *posix-argv*))
       (document (slurp filename))
       (threshold (read-from-string (nth 2 *posix-argv*)))
       (i 0))
   (dolist (x (proc document))
      (if (&gt; (car x) threshold)
         (format t &quot;~d, ~8,7f, ~a. ~%&quot; i (car x) (cdr x)))
         (incf i)))</code></pre>
<p>When you run this on the command-line, the first argument you provide
must be the full path name of the file you’d like to summarize, and the
second argument is a real number something of the order of
<code>1.0 </code>which controls the size of the summary: the larger the
value is, the shorter the summary gets. So, play with it until you are
satisfied with the summary. I piped the result into</p>
<pre><code> | awk -F, &#39;{ print $3; }&#39; | tr &#39;\n&#39; &#39; &#39; | par</code></pre>
<p>to make the output more readable. Also, make sure that the text is
cleaned: replace shorthands such as ‘U.S.’ with ‘US’ since we split the
text into sentences using full-stops.</p>
<h2 id="several-tests">Several tests</h2>
<p>I used the summarizer on several types of documents. I got the best
results on news articles. So, here is one example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>with its decision which angered the fbi and other law enforcement
agencies the administration essentially agreed with apple google
microsoft and a group of the nations top cryptographers and computer
scientists that millions of americans would be vulnerable to hacking if
technology firms and smartphone manufacturers were required to provide
the government with back doors or access to their source code and
encryption keys. current technology puts the keys for access to the
information in the hands of the individual user not the companies. the
first indication of the retreat came on thursday when the fbi director
james b comey told the senate homeland security and governmental affairs
committee that the administration would not seek legislation to compel
the companies to create such a portal. while the administration said it
would continue to try to persuade companies like apple and google to
assist in criminal and national security investigations it determined
that the government should not force them to breach the security of
their products. what frustrated him was that apple had designed the
system to ensure that the company never held on to the keys putting them
entirely in the hands of users through the codes or fingerprints they
use to get into their phones.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a
href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/politics/obama-wont-seek-access-to-encrypted-user-data.html">original</a>
was a story published at <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">New York
Times</a>. I ran the text with <code>1.5</code> after some
pre-processing. It is very good, except for the last sentence that has
“what frustrated him” for which we have no reference.</p>
<p>Here is another example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>at least 128 people were killed and more than 200 were wounded when
two suspected suicide bombers targeted a peace rally organised by
several leftist groups including labour unions and the prokurdish
peoples democratic party hdp to call for an end to the escalating
violence between the turkish government and the outlawed kurdistan
workers party pkk. demonstrators witnesses victims families and
opposition leaders widely condemned the government and in almost all
interviews ascribed direct responsibility for the deaths at the feet of
erdoğan saying the police had failed to provide any security measures to
protect the rallys attendees and had even teargassed relatives of the
victims as they arrived at the scene of the attack looking for their
loved ones. ahmet who was at the funeral and survived the previous days
blast said security forces were completely absent in the leadup to the
rally. he said the police attacked those who arrived at the scene or
tried to assist the victims with teargas firing bullets into the air and
sowing panic among the attendees. in addition to pointing at the ones
who did this looking over the past year the ones who are targeted are
the opposition those who want peace defenders of human rights and the
democratic struggle in turkey he said. as the families of the dead
marched through the crowds some weeping in agony the condemnations grew
more furious. i came to leave flowers and to share in the pain of the
families. but far from the roiling fury and politics a lone man sat
under the gathering clouds on the pavement in front of the hospital his
face resting on his palm and his voice a barely audible whisper his eyes
bearing a look of immense grief.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <a
href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/11/thousands-gather-in-ankara-to-pay-respects-to-activists-killed-in-bombings">original</a>
was a story on <a href="http://www.theguardian.com">the Guardian</a> on
a recent bombing in Turkey which claimed 100 lives. I ran the script
with the parameter <code>1.4</code>.</p>
<p>Here is an example I used earlier: Kennedy’s Inaguration speech from
1961. I ran the code with the parameter <code>1.7</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>and yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forbearers
fought are still at issue around the globe the belief that the rights of
man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of god.
let the word go forth from this time and place to friend and foe alike
that the torch has been passed to a new generation of americans born in
this century tempered by war disciplined by a hard and bitter peace
proud of our ancient heritage and unwilling to witness or permit the
slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been
committed and to which we are committed today at home and around the
world. to that world assembly of sovereign states the united nations our
last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced
the instruments of peace we renew our pledge of support to prevent it
from becoming merely a forum for invective to strengthen its shield of
the new and the weak and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run.
and if a beachhead of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion
let both sides join in creating a new endeavor not a new balance of
power but a new world of law where the strong are just and the weak
secure and the peace preserved.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally an example that didn’t work well. <a
href="http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-46_bqmc.pdf">A
recent US Supreme court decision on EPA</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>congress directed the agency to perform a study of the hazards to
public health reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of emissions
by power plants of hazardous air pollutants after imposition of the
requirements of this chapter 7412n1a. the government concedes that if
the agency were to find that emissions from power plants do damage to
human health but that the technologies needed to eliminate these
emissions do even more damage to human health it would still deem
regulation appropriate see tr of oral arg 70. this directive to epa to
study cost is a further indication of the relevance of cost to the
decision to regulate. american trucking thus establishes the modest
principle that where the clean air act expressly directs epa to regulate
on the basis of a factor that on its face does not include cost the act
normally should not be read as implicitly allowing the agency to
consider cost anyway. congress crafted narrow standards for epa to apply
when deciding whether to regulate other sources in general these
standards concern the volume of pollution emitted by the source 7412c1
and the threat posed by the source to human health or the environment
7412c3. for example the dissent claims that the floor standards which
the act calibrates to reflect emissions limitations already achieved by
the bestperforming sources in the industry reflect cost considerations
because the bestperforming power plants must have considered costs in
arriving at their emissions outputs post at 10.<br />
</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>
<p>The summarizer works well for texts of moderate length. It makes the
algorithm suitable for things like news articles, opinion pieces and
blog posts. Even though it is tempting, it would not yield usable
results for texts which contain dense cross-references such as the US
Supreme Court decision text I used above.</p>
