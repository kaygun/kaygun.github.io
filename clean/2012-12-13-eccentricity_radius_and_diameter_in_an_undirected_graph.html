<h1
id="eccentricity-radius-and-diameter-in-an-undirected-graph">Eccentricity,
Radius and Diameter in an Undirected Graph</h1>
<h2 id="description-of-the-problem">Description of the problem</h2>
<p>Given an undirected connected graph <span class="math inline">\(G =
(V,E)\)</span> without loops there is a well-defined notion of distance
between two vertices <span class="math inline">\(x,y\in V\)</span>. The
distance between <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (which I will denote by <span
class="math inline">\(d(x,y)\)</span> is defined <em>geodesically</em>:
it is the length of the shortest path between <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the graph comes with weighed edges (i.e. carry numerical values),
then instead of calculating the length of a path merely counting the
number of edges in a path, we can calculate the total weight of a path
by adding the weights of edges appering in that path. In that case, the
distance is defined similarly. In fact, we can recover the original
notion of the distance if we set the default weight of each edge to
1.</p>
<p>Now, we can define the three notions that I am going to use in this
post: the eccentricity of a vertex, the radius and diameter of a
graph.</p>
<p>Given a vertex <span class="math inline">\(x\in V\)</span>, the
<em>eccentricity</em> of a vertex is the maximum of all distances at
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>. In other words <span
class="math display">\[ Ecc(x) := \max
\{d(x,y)\|\ y\in V \} \]</span> Now, we can also define the diameter and
the radius of a graph as follows: <span class="math display">\[ rad(G)
:= \min \{Ecc(x)\|\
x\in V\} \]</span> <span class="math display">\[ diam(G) := \max
\{Ecc(x)\|\ x\in V\} \]</span> There is a nice shortcut defining the
diameter though <span class="math display">\[ diam(G) =
\max_{x\in X}Ecc(x) = \max_{x\in X}\max_{y\in X} d(x,y) \]</span> In
other words, the diameter is the maximum of all possible distances
between all pairs of vertices.</p>
<p>Today, I would like to construct algorithms with functioning lisp
code which calculate these quantities for a given undirected graph.</p>
<h2 id="a-solution">A solution</h2>
<h3 id="eccentricity-algorithm">Eccentricity algorithm</h3>
<p>The algorithm for calculating the eccentricity of a vertex <span
class="math inline">\(v\in V\)</span> is going to gradually remove
vertices and edges until the graph is empty. The number of steps until
the graph becomes empty will give us the eccentricity of that vertex.
The pseudo-code is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>function Ecc(x)
  A &lt;- {x}
  n &lt;- 0
  while E is not empty do
     B &lt;- {} 
     for each y in A do
        add neighbors of y to B
        remove all edges adjacent to y
     end for
     A &lt;- B
     n &lt;- n+1
  end while
  return n
end function</code></pre>
<p>The set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> initially contains
only the vertex <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the empty set. Our counter <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is initially <span
class="math inline">\(0\)</span>. Now, for each vertex <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> we add the vertices connected to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> to the set <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and remove <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> together with all edges adjacent to
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. Note that it is crucial that
<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> contains no loops as we do not
want a vertex to be nieghboring itself via a loop. At the end of the
<code>for each</code> loop <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>
contains the set of neighboring vertices to the vertices in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> lost all edges adjacent to the vertices
in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. We increase the counting
index by one.</p>
<h3
id="complexity-and-correctness-of-the-eccentricity-algorithm">Complexity
and correctness of the eccentricity algorithm</h3>
<p>Let me show that the algorithm works correctly. Consider the
penultimate step in the algorithm. The set <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> will contain vertices which will make
the edge set empty when we remove the adjacent vertices. Let <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> be one of these vertices in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> at this step. If there were a shorter
path from <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> of length smaller than the value of the
counter <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we would have removed
<span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> earlier and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> would not have appeared in <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in this step. In other words, a vertex
is removed at step <span class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> (i.e. when
the counter is <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) when its distance
to <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>. This means the distance between
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(y\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>. Hence <span
class="math inline">\(Ecc(x)\geq n+1\)</span>. If the eccentricity of
<span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> were strictly greater than <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span> caused by a vertex <span
class="math inline">\(z\in V\)</span> with <span
class="math inline">\(d(x,z)\&gt;n+1\)</span> this vertex could not have
been removed earlier because the distance between <span
class="math inline">\(z\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span> is greater than <span
class="math inline">\(n+1\)</span>. If such a vertex exists then there
are going to be edges remained after this step which is not possible. So
<span class="math inline">\(Ecc(x)\leq n+1\)</span> too showing that the
algorithm works correctly.</p>
<p>The time complexity of the algorithm is <span
class="math inline">\(O(\|V\|\|E\|^2)\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="the-distance-algorithm-and-its-correctness">The distance
algorithm and its correctness</h3>
<p>We can modify the eccentricity algorithm slightly to get the distance
algorithm as follows</p>
<pre><code>function d(x,y)
   A &lt;- {x}
   n &lt;- 0
   while y is not in A
       B &lt;- {}
       for each z in A do
           add neighbors of z to B
           remove all edges adjacent to z
       end for
       n &lt;- n+1
       A &lt;- B
   end while
   return n
end function</code></pre>
<p>I already gave the argument for correctness of this algorithm above
when I showed the correctness of the eccentricity algorithm.</p>
<h2 id="lisp-implementation">Lisp implementation</h2>
<h3 id="the-data-structure">The data structure</h3>
<p>For the lisp implementation, I will assume that each edge is
represented by a list of integers of length 2 such as <code>(1 0)</code>
where the integers are used as labels for the vertices. I will assume
each vertex has a distinct non-negative integer label. For testing
purposes, let us define a graph:</p>
<pre><code>(defparameter G &#39;((0 1) (1 2) (1 3) (3 4) (4 5) (2 4) (3 5) (0 6) (2 6)))
G</code></pre>
<figure data-orig-height="443" data-orig-width="252">
<img
src="../media/2012-12-13-eccentricity_radius_and_diameter_in_an_undirected_graph_0.png"
data-orig-height="443" data-orig-width="252" />
</figure>
<h3 id="eccentricity-the-radius-and-the-diameter">Eccentricity, the
radius and the diameter</h3>
<p>Now, I will need a function which extracts the set of vertices from a
given set of edges</p>
<pre><code>(defun vertices (x) (sort (remove-duplicates (reduce &#39;append x)) &#39;&lt;))
VERTICES</code></pre>
<p>Let us test it on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span></p>
<pre><code>(vertices G)
(0 1 2 3 4 5 6)</code></pre>
<p>Now, I need a function which lists the neighbors of a vertex <span
class="math inline">\(x\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>(defun neighbors (x G) 
   (let ((H (append G (mapcar &#39;reverse G)))
         res)
      (dolist (y H) (if (equal (cadr y) x) (push (car y) res)))
      (remove-duplicates res)))
NEIGHBORS</code></pre>
<p>Let us test it on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>(mapcar (lambda (x) (neighbors x G)) (vertices G))
((6 1) (3 2 0) (6 4 1) (5 4 1) (5 2 3) (3 4) (2 0))</code></pre>
<p>Next, I am going to need a function which removes the edges adjacent
to a given vertex</p>
<pre><code>(defun remove-adjacent (x G) 
   (remove-if (lambda (u) (or (equal (car u) x) (equal (cadr u) x))) G))
REMOVE-ADJACENT</code></pre>
<p>and we test if on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>(remove-adjacent 2 G)
((0 1) (1 3) (3 4) (4 5) (3 5) (0 6))</code></pre>
<figure data-orig-height="443" data-orig-width="215">
<img
src="../media/2012-12-13-eccentricity_radius_and_diameter_in_an_undirected_graph_1.png"
data-orig-height="443" data-orig-width="215" />
</figure>
<p>Finally, we are ready to implement the eccentricity and the distance
functions.</p>
<pre><code>(defun eccentricity (x G)
   (let ((A (list x))
         (B nil)
         (H G))
      (do ((n 0 (1+ n)))
          ((null H) n)
         (setf B (loop for y in A append (neighbors y H)))
         (dolist (y A) (setf H (remove-adjacent y H)))
         (setf A B))))
ECCENTRICITY</code></pre>
<p>And we test it on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>(mapcar (lambda (x) (eccentricity x G)) (vertices G))
(4 3 3 3 3 4 4)</code></pre>
<p>That little piece of code is also the basis of our calculation of the
radius and the diameter. The function below returns first the radius and
then the diameter as a list.</p>
<pre><code>(defun radius-diameter (G)
    (let ((base (mapcar (lambda (x) (eccentricity x G)) (vertices G))))
       (list (reduce &#39;min base) (reduce &#39;max base))))
RADIUS-DIAMETER</code></pre>
<p>And we test it on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<pre><code>(radius-diameter G)
(3 4)</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-distance-function">The distance function</h3>
<p>The implementation of the distance function is going to be similar to
the implementation of the eccentricity function</p>
<pre><code>(defun distance (x y G)
   (let ((A (list x))
         (B nil)
         (H G))
      (do ((n 0 (1+ n)))
          ((member y A) n)
         (setf B (loop for y in A append (neighbors y H)))
         (dolist (y A) (setf H (remove-adjacent y H)))
         (setf A B))))
DISTANCE</code></pre>
<p>Let us test this on <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span></p>
<pre><code>(loop for i from 1 to 12 collect 
   (let ((x (random 6)) (y (random 6))) (list x y (distance x y G))))
((5 1 2) (3 0 2) (1 0 1) (3 1 1) (2 4 1) (4 5 1) (3 3 0) (5 5 0) (1 3 1)
 (4 0 3) (3 0 2) (0 1 1))</code></pre>
