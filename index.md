## The Kitchen Sink and Other Oddities

### Python Stuff 

#### A Short Crash-Course on Python

Here are the [jupyter][1] notebooks for a short series of [python][2] lectures
I gave to a bunch of undergrads back in 2015.

* [Lecture 1](https://github.com/kaygun/Python_Lectures/blob/master/Lecture1.ipynb)
* [Lecture 2](https://github.com/kaygun/Python_Lectures/blob/master/Lecture2.ipynb)
* [Lecture 3](https://github.com/kaygun/Python_Lectures/blob/master/Lecture3.ipynb)

If you'd like to play with these lectures, first install [jupyter][1] then dowload these jupyter notebooks and 
run them through.

### Clojure Stuff

#### A Short Crash-Course on Clojure

[Clojure][3] is a language within the [lisp][4] family of languages.  Here are some
[Gorilla-REPL][5] notebooks I prepared for a series of lectures on clojure for a group
of computer engineering undergrads.  

* [Lecture 1](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=kaygun&repo=Clojure_Lectures&path=Lecture1.clj)
* [Lecture 2](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=kaygun&repo=Clojure_Lectures&path=Lecture2.clj)
* [Lecture 3](http://viewer.gorilla-repl.org/view.html?source=github&user=kaygun&repo=Clojure_Lectures&path=Lecture3.clj)

[Gorilla-REPL][5] allows one to use notebook interface to present clojure code together with narrative.  I like 
it because it is easier to install compared to [jupyter][1].  But unfortunately, it works only for clojure as opposed to 
[jupyter][2] which has plugins for [a wide range of languages][6]

### Data Stuff

#### A Short Course on Data Science

I prepared a series of short lectures on best practices in data science and basic algorithms for a [conference][7]
but I couldn't make it at the time. Friends from [miletos][8] did the presentations for me.  The lecture notes are below:

* [Lecture 1](http://web.itu.edu.tr/kaygun/Programming/data.html)
* [Lecture 2](http://web.itu.edu.tr/kaygun/Programming/ml.html)

I used [org-mode][9] with [babel][11] on [emacs][10] to prepare the notes. As much as I like [jupyter][1] and 
[gorilla-repl][5] for teaching purposes, my regular work flow uses emacs heavily.
