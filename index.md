### Python Lectures

#### A Short Crash-Course in Python

Here are the [jupyter][1] notebooks for a short series of [python](https://python.org) lectures
I gave to a buch of undergrads back in 2015.

* [Lecture 1](https://github.com/kaygun/Python_Lectures/blob/master/Lecture1.ipynb)
* [Lecture 2](https://github.com/kaygun/Python_Lectures/blob/master/Lecture2.ipynb)
* [Lecture 3](https://github.com/kaygun/Python_Lectures/blob/master/Lecture3.ipynb)

If you'd like to play with these lectures, first install [jupyter][1] then dowload these jupyter notebooks and 
run them through.
